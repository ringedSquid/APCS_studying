		/* Types of operators
		 *
		 * postfix increment and decrement
		 * 	x++
		 * 	x--
		 *
		 * prefix increment, decrement, unary (prefixes)
		 * 	++x
		 * 	--x
		 * 	+x
		 * 	-x
		 * 	~x
		 * 	!x
		 *
		 * multiplicative
		 * 	x * y
		 * 	x / y
		 * 	x % y
		 *
		 * additive
		 * 	x + y
		 * 	x - y
		 * 	concatenation
		 *
		 * relational
		 * 	x < y
		 * 	x > y
		 * 	x <= y
		 * 	x >= y
		 *
		 * equality
		 * 	x == y
		 * 	x != y
		 *
		 * logical AND
		 * 	x && y
		 *
		 * logical OR
		 * 	x || y
		 *
		 * assignment
		 * 	x = y
		 * 	x += y
		 * 	x -= y
		 * 	x *= y
		 * 	x /= y
		 * 	x %= y
		 * 	
		 * The order of which these operators are introduced
		 * is their precedence.
		 *	Most important ones to remember
		 *	&& is before ||
		 *	prefix before postfix or other
		 *	relational before equality
		 *
		 * a-++c-++b is equivalent to a-(++c)-(++b)
		 *
		 * 1 * 2 + 3 + "abc" = "5abc"
		 * 1 + 2 + "abc" + 1 * 2 = "3abc2"
		 *
		 * Assignment
		 *
		 * a = b
		 *
		 * assigns value of a into b
		 * Reference values get their addresses copied
		 *
		 * compatible types go through the automatic widening process
		 * incompatible types cannot be assigned to each other
		 *
		 * smaller assigned to bigger -> converts to bigger
		* DOUBLE CANNOT BE CONVERTED TO INTS BUT INTS TO DOUBLES
			 * double b = 1/2, 1 and 2 convert to double before div
